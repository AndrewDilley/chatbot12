Numbers should always be spelt out if they are used to start a sentence e.g. Twenty projects will begin. Spell out first to ninth; use numerals for 10th and above e.g. second place, 10th anniversary. Exceptions Always use numerals for currency  e.g. $4 million project, $5 entrance fee, 5 cent refund.Always use numerals for percentages  e.g. 3 per cent, 15 per cent. Always refer to per cent as two separate words, not as percent or %. Temperatures Always use numerals e.g. 5 degrees, 20 degrees, minus 2 degrees (not -2) Measurements In the first instance, the unit should be spelt out, before it is abbreviated. The following short forms are acceptable: Fluid : megalitre - ML, kilolitre - kl,", "Our Voice Guide - January 2023.pdf"], ["litre - lt (not l as it is too easily confused with the figure 1), millilitre (ml). Length : kilometre - km, metre - m, centimetre - cm, millimetre - m. Weight : tonne - t, kilogram - kg, gram - g, milligram - mg. Area : square kilometre - sq km, hectare - h, square metre - sq m. Volume : cubic metre - cu m, cubic centimetre - cc. NOTE: Number refers to things we can count e.g. number of people. Amount refers to quantities we can measure e.g. amount of water. Dates Our format is  date, month, year e.g. 5 February 2023. Don't use 'th', 'st' etc at the end of the date. If you are referring to a financial year, the format is 2022/23  (not 2022-23, 2022/2023 or 2022-2023).

Times Use the 12-hour clock with a colon between the hours and minutes. Don't use additional 00 for times on the hour e.g. our office hours are 8:15am to 5pm (not 5:00pm). Don't add a space between the number and the 'am' or 'pm'. Use 'noon' or 'midnight' instead of '12' or '12 noon' or '12 midnight'.

The apostrophe is always placed where the letter/s have been removed. Some common examples are: \u2022 couldn't - could not \u2022 doesn't - does not \u2022 don't - do not", "Our Voice Guide - January 2023.pdf"], ["\u2022 he'll - he will \u2022 I'd - I would \u2022 I'll - I will \u2022 I'm - I am \u2022 isn't - is not \u2022 it's - it is OR it has \u2022 she'd - she would \u2022 we're  - we are \u2022 who's - who is \u2022 you'll - you will \u2022 you're  - you are.Possession Possessive apostrophes show that a thing (a noun) belongs or is related to someone or something else. Singular nouns and names When the noun is singular, add an apostrophe plus 's' e.g:  Wannon Water's pipeline, one week's notice. When a singular noun already ends in 's', add an apostrophe plus another 's' (the general rule is you should write it as you say it) e.g: James's pen. Plural nouns For plural nouns that end with an 's', add an apostrophe AFTER the 's'. For example if there is more than one water authority or week e.g:  The water authorities' pipelines, two weeks' notice.", "Our Voice Guide - January 2023.pdf"], ["For plural nouns that don't end with an 's' (e.g. children, men and women), add an apostrophe BEFORE the 's' e.g: The children's poster competition, International Women's Day.It\u2019s vs its One of the most common apostrophe mistakes is placing an apostrophe in the word ITS to show something belongs to IT. But this rule doesn\u2019t apply to pronouns \u2013 its, yours, his, hers, ours, theirs. As outlined, it\u2019s is always a contraction of 'it is' or 'it has'. Its describes something that belongs to it e.g: The committee elected its president, the vehicle had its service. The easiest way to remember this rule is to read it back to yourself. The committee elected it's president effectively reads the committee elected it is president, which doesn't make sense. When NOT to use an apostrophe", "Our Voice Guide - January 2023.pdf"], ["Don't use an apostrophe just because a word is plural e.g. reports (not report's), USBs  (not USB's), 1990s  (not 1990's). However, if you are referring to something that belongs to a decade, add an apostrophe e.g. the 1990s' pipeline . Wannon Water   |   Our Voice Guide   |   Jan 2023   |   PAGE 16 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples , Use culturally appropriate and respectful language when writing with, for, or about First Nations Australians. \u2018Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples\u2019 is most often considered best practice. Using 'First Peoples' and \u2018First Nations\u2019 is also generally acceptable. Age diversity Avoid referring to a person\u2019s age or an age group if it\u2019s not relevant. Standalone words in everyday use, like \u2018old\u2019 and \u2018young\u2019, can carry", "Our Voice Guide - January 2023.pdf"], ["bias or unintended subtext. Words that carry stereotypes, for example \u2018elderly\u2019, are not acceptable.

Respect peoples\u2019 preferences around gender and sexual identity with pronoun choice, job titles and personal titles. Do not default to a generic gendered pronoun like 'he' or 'she' to talk about a generic person. Instead, use 'they', 'their' and 'them' to refer to singular subjects as this allows you to speak to a broader audience of men, women, and other identifying genders.", "Our Voice Guide - January 2023.pdf"], ["Unless gender is relevant, always use gender- neutral words rather than gender-specific ones. For example, use 'workforce' instead of 'manpower', 'artificial' instead of 'man made', and 'access point' rather than 'manhole'. Don\u2019t ask for a preferred title (e.g. Mr, Mrs, Ms) or gender identity in a form or survey unless you specifically need to collect this information. On a side note, when giving addressing a group, avoid the term \"ladies and gentlemen\". Instead, simply use 'good morning', 'good afternoon' or 'welcome everyone' which are all inclusive.People with a disability Disability does not define people. Use inclusive language that respects diversity e.g: person with disability  (NOT disabled person), person who is deaf or hard of hearing  (NOT", "Our Voice Guide - January 2023.pdf"], ["deaf person), person who is blind or has low vision  (NOT blind person). Cultural and linguistic diversity Australians have different cultural backgrounds and speak many languages. Use inclusive language that respects this diversity. You can use the general term \u2018multicultural communities\u2019 to write about people from different cultural backgrounds. When you ask people their name, don\u2019t ask for \u2018Christian name\u2019, \u2018first name\u2019, \u2018forename\u2019 or \u2018surname\u2019.

The borefield capacity was increased significantly to 1 ML/d in the Millennium drought. An important feature of the system is that approximately half of the demand on the system is from the rural users along the Willaura pipeline, before the pipeline reaches the Glenthompson reservoir.  These customers have similar access to water as Grampians Wimmera Mallee Water\u2019s (GWMW) rural", "Urban Water Strategy 2022.pdf"], ["customers on the upstream pipeline.

Wannon Water liaises with GWMW in respect of the timing of delivery from the Willaura pipeline to Glenthompson Reservoir.  The security of the town supply is heavily reliant on this delivery because the local catchment for Glenthompson reservoir does not produce runoff in dry years. The Willaura System is managed by GWMW.

Also, despite any restrictions in this By-law, water can be used at any time: \u2022 for human health requirements; \u2022 for watering of stock and animals; \u2022 for fire fighting; \u2022 for the safety, but not the cleaning, of vehicles and equipment; and \u2022 for cleaning required as a result of an accident, fire, health hazard, safety hazard or other emergency  (in accordance with the permitted methods) .", "Urban Water Strategy 2022.pdf"], ["Where a restriction relates to a specific use of water, that restriction applies regardless of whether the use is indoors or outdoors .  For example, indoor pools and fountains and undercover nurseries are covered by the same restrictions as equivalent outdoor facilities.

This means that unless the restrictions in this By-law specify rules about the way in which water can be used outdoors for a particular purpose, then water cannot be used for that purpose.

For example, wherever restrictions in this By-law allow for water to be use d from a hand -held hose for any purpose, that hose must be leak -free and used with a trigger nozzle, consistent with th e permanent water saving rules.", "Urban Water Strategy 2022.pdf"], ["Contravention of this By-law is an offence under the Water Act 1989 , and so  penalties may apply.

This can lead to the generation of misleading or incorrect information.
